# Design Process

What is the design process for Wandertext? Because just writing acceptance
tests seemed to be introducing ersatz complexity (on-the-fly components, etc.)

1. User Stories
   - Describe in detail the functionality of Wandertext
   - Focus on routing, behavior, etc. NOT on components.
2. Wireframes
   - Inherit behavior and recreate the routing from the user stories
   - Begin suggesting what components are necessary and where there is
     repetition, etc.
3. Integration testing w/ components
   - Components have been implied by the wireframes.
4. Convert user stories into legit acceptance tests.
